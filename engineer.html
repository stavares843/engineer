  "Sara is very smart, exceedingly hard working, and always looking for any way to help anyone on the team, even if it's outside of her normal duties. 
  While her title is QA Manager, she continually adds value and helps with business, dev, community engagement, product management, and anywhere else that needs it. Sara is also adept at finding ways to automate and make use of new tech to streamline business and dev processes. I enjoy working with Sara immensely, and feel lucky I get to work with her."

  "Sara is one of the most dedicated employees I have ever worked with. She works in the opposite time zone as me and yet she is always available. She knows every PR and what status it is in. She knows of every bug and has them all in the ticketing system already. She automates everything around her and maybe to a fault! She knows the tools well (Git, JIRA, etc.) and minimizes the impact to developers for even simple stuff like moving a ticket to "completed" after a PR is merged."

  "I would highly recommend Sara as she would be a great addition anywhere she works. I was brand new into QA when I started working with Sara and she spent a countless amount of time with me teaching me everything I would need to know and more to make sure I was confident and well knowledge'd in my role.
  She is very experienced and highly detailed in the work that she does and always up to date on everything to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. As a manager she always made sure we had everything we needed to succeed and clearly understood the goals that needed to be met. She would go above and beyond and be there day or night to help anyone out with any issues that were blocking them. Sara is an easy person to work with and I am very confident she will do great any place she works at."

  "I would like to start the recommendation about Sara by saying how everyone likes her. An amazing manager for the QAs where everyone learns a lot from her. I add that in addition to the tests, she made many configurations and templates that helped us developers a lot. She is excellent at running tests and managing a team."

  "I really enjoyed working with Sara at Satellite.IM. During her time as my QA manager for our team, she consistently went above and beyond in providing all the required resources and support to complete our tasks. Not only did Sara share her extensive knowledge and expertise on the technologies we were working with, but she also encouraged me to continue learning and challenging myself. Of course I have to mention that she was always willing to take on additional responsibilities, and her dedication and hard work were greatly appreciated by the entire team. Sara would become a true asset to any organization, and I highly recommend her. She will undoubtedly be an invaluable addition to any team and bring a wealth of knowledge, experience, and positive energy to the table."

  "I highly recommend Sara as a QA engineer. She is incredibly thorough and skilled in the areas of test automation, cypress, and ci/cd. I have had the pleasure of working with Sara on our core product and have been consistently impressed by her attention to detail and ability to identify and address potential issues before they become problems. Sara has a great understanding of QA methodologies and is able to develop and implement effective test plans that ensure the quality of our products. She is also an expert in cypress and has used it to automate a significant portion of our QA processes, which has greatly improved the efficiency of our team. Additionally, Sara is knowledgeable about ci/cd and has helped us implement a seamless pipeline that allows us to quickly and confidently deploy new versions of our software. In summary, Sara is a valuable asset to any team and I highly recommend her for any QA engineering role. She is a skilled and dedicated professional who consistently delivers excellent results."

  "Sara provided needed research for our team at Osmosis in identifying, setting up, and engaging engineers in creating E2E tests. She also covered numerous organizational gaps to make sure that we could always get what needed to be done done in a small and agile startup. She was a strong team player who proactively filled needs the team had."

  <div class="testimonial">
  "It is my true pleasure to recommend Sara. I had the good fortune of working with her at Osmosis. From day one of joining Osmosis, Sara was clearly someone who was in tune with every little need and detail, and she would frequently communicate across teams to collaborate in order to solve problems and ideate around solutions and best practices. She was always the “go to” every time there was a technical concern, and I was consistently impressed with her timely responses and genuine passion to help and offer solutions to her teammates and stakeholders anytime an issue arose. Above all else, Sara is pleasant, kind, and dedicated. Any team would be very lucky to work with her!"

  "Sara and I worked closely together in a fast paced environment, and it was absolutely delightful to work with her. Sara has impressive super-human skills to keep tabs with different contexts and discussions, which's something extremely useful, specially due to the nature of her work. She leverages the toolings available to multiply her productivity, which makes communication across different teams very smooth and fast, driving solutions to root cause of problems very efficiently. Sara cares deeply about the product, has a strong sense of ownership, and demonstrates pro-activeness even in areas that shouldn't be her direct responsibility, which shows how deeply she cares about the overall goal of the company, and doesn't stick to her specific duties only. On the technical end, Sara is one of the best QA engineers I've worked with, and unsurprisingly this opinion is shared amongst our all of our peers."

  <div class="swiper-slide">
  <div class="testimonial">
  "One of our core values at Osmosis is "Have Each Other's Backs," meaning being reliable and supportive. Sara is the epitome of this value both for her teammates as well as for our learners. There have been a number of times I've noticed something that could be improved - from small things like a typo on a landing page to large things like a bug in the mobile app - and Sara either (a) already noticed it and initiated a fix, or (b) responded within minutes and then circled back to close the loop once it's fixed. On a few of these occasions I had actually forgotten about the quality improvement request but was pleasantly surprised when she pinged me saying it was fixed, which shows her strong attention to detail. Sara does not let things fall through the cracks. She's also a pleasure to work with and has mastered the ability to communicate kindly and joyfully in written form. Highly recommend working with her."

  "Sara is a very very talented QA. She loves the job and the bugs hate her. Beyond QA, Sara was a trustworthy person who always knew how to take her responsibilities and always defend the interest of the company. Sara has always demonstrated great flexibility to learn new things in and outside of her specialization. I hope I can rely on his services again."
